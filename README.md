# Getting-and-cleaning-data
Course project on getting and cleaning data
1.	The dataset from the web was downloaded and extracted into a working directory
2.	packages data.table and dplyr were used to analyse the dataset.
The training and test datasets present in different files were split into subject, activity and features
The datasets were then merged to create one dataset.
the respective data in training and test data sets corresponding to subject, activity and features was combined and stored as subject, activity and features
The columns in the features dataset were named from the metadata and the merged data in features, activity and subject was stored in completeData.
The measurements for the mean and standard deviation was extracted and descriptive names were assigned to the activities in the dataset 
Finally 'Tidy Dataset' that consists of the average (mean) of each variable for each subject and each activity was generated and the results were stored in Tidy.txt.
